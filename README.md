# Eslam Sife

**Principle Backend Engineer** focused on building maintainable, scalable systems with Java and Spring.

## What I Work On

I design and implement backend services for enterprise environments, with emphasis on:

- **Data pipeline architecture** — ETL systems, database migrations, batch processing
- **API design** — RESTful services with clean layered architecture
- **System integration** — Connecting heterogeneous systems while maintaining data integrity

## Technical Expertise

```
Backend:       Java 17-21 • Spring Boot • Spring Batch • Spring Data JPA
Data:          SQL Server • PostgreSQL • SQLite • JDBC
Architecture:  Layered architecture • Domain-driven design • Microservices patterns
DevOps:        Docker • Docker Compose • CI/CD
Auth:          Keycloak • OAuth 2.0 • JWT
```

## Featured Projects

### [Database Exporter](https://github.com/EslamSife/database-exporter)
Production-grade SQL Server export tool with topological FK resolution for data migration scenarios.
- Dependency graph analysis with cycle detection
- Factory pattern for testable component assembly
- Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.5

### [Employee Portal API](https://github.com/EslamSife/EmployeePortal-BackEnd)
RESTful backend demonstrating JPA Specifications for dynamic queries without query explosion.
- Composable filter/sort without N repository methods
- DTO/Entity separation for API stability
- Containerized deployment with Docker

### [Spring Batch ETL](https://github.com/EslamSife/Batch-Single-Transaction)
Chunk-based data processing pipeline with job listeners and transaction management.
- Reader/Processor/Writer pattern
- Automatic transaction boundaries per chunk
- Job execution monitoring

## Approach

I prioritize:

1. **Clarity over cleverness** — Code should be readable by the next engineer
2. **Explicit dependencies** — Constructor injection, no hidden state
3. **Appropriate abstractions** — Solve today's problem, design for tomorrow's growth
4. **Production concerns** — Logging, error handling, and observability from day one
